    <h1 class="heading-large">Message statuses</h1>

    <p>When you send a message using GOV.UK Notify, it moves through different states.</p>
    <p>Notify’s real-time dashboard lets you check the status of any message, to see when it was delivered. You can also use our API to check the status of your messages.</p>
    <p>For security, this information is only available for 7 days after a message has been sent. You can download a report, including a list of sent messages, for your own records.</p>

    <p>If you're using our API, some of the statuses you'll see will be different. <a href="https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/documentation">Read our documentation</a> for a detailed list of API message statuses.</p>
