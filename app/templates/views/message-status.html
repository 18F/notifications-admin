    <p>When you send a message using GOV.UK Notify, it moves through different states.</p>
    <p>Notify’s real-time dashboard lets you check the status of any message, to see when it was delivered. You can use our API to check the status of your messages too.</p>
    <p>For security, this information is only available for X days after a message has been sent. You can download a list of sent messages for your own records.</p>
