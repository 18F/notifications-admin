    Billing report shows data for period between start date and end date, inclusive of both dates.

  <p class="govuk-body">
    Explanation for more confusing column names in the report:
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>sms cost - cost accrued by a service through sending text messages after they run out of free allowance</li>
    <li>sms chargeable units - sms fragments that go over free allowance multiplied by rate multiplier (so higher costs of sending international SMS are taken into consideration)</li>
    <li>letter cost - cost accrued by a service through sending letters (number of letters * numbers of paper sheets * postage)</li>
    <li>letter breakdown - amount and cost of letters sent by a service for each postage class</li>
    <li> purchase order number, contact names, contact email addresses, billing reference - this data is manually filled in by us based on the information we get from services. You can help by filling it in (on Service Settings page)</li>

  </ul>
