    <h3 class="heading heading-small">Send files by email</h3>
      <p>You can use the GOV.UK Notify API to upload a file, then send the recipient an email with a secure link to download it.</p>
      <p>Notify uses encrypted links instead of email attachments because:</p>
        <ul class="list bullet-list">
          <li>they're more secure</li>
          <li>you can track when the recipient downloads your document</li>
          <li>email attachments are often marked as spam</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Read the API documentation for more information.</p>
