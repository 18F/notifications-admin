    <h1 class="heading-large">Integration testing</h1>

    <p>
      Service teams should do all their testing within the GOV.UK Notify production environment (https://api.notifications.service.gov.uk).
    </p>
    <p>
        You don’t need different Notify accounts or access to other Notify environments. Instead, there are different types of API key that let you do functional or performance integration testing.
    </p>

    <h2 class="heading-medium">API Keys</h2>
    <p>
        The 3 types of API key that you can create within GOV.UK Notify are:
    </p>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>live key - “Send messages to anyone”</li>
      <li>team key - “Send messages to anyone on my whitelist”</li>
       <li>test key - “Pretend to send messages to anyone"</li>
    </ul>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">Live key</h2>
    <p>
        Once your service is live you are able to create Live keys. You can then use these key to send messages to anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
        Messages sent with a live key show up on your dashboard and count against your text message and email allowances.
    </p>
      <p>
          You should plan to rotate these keys on a regular basis. You may have more than one active key at a time. To revoke the key simply click the revoke button on the API Key page.
      </p>

    <h2 class="heading-medium">Team key</h2>
    <p>
     Use a team key for end-to-end functional testing.
    </p>
    <p>
        A team key lets you send real messages to members of your team (and addresses/numbers that you have added to your whitelist). You will get an error if you use these keys to send messages to anyone else.
    </p>
    <p>
        Messages sent with a team key show up on your dashboard and count against your text message and email allowances.
    </p>

    <h2 class="heading-medium">Test key</h2>
      <p>
        Use a test key to test the performance of your service and its integration with GOV.UK Notify under load.
      </p>
      <p>
          A test key doesn’t send real messages but generates realistic responses. There’s no restriction on who you can send to or how many messages you can send per day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Messages sent using a test key don’t show up on your dashboard or count against your text message and email allowances.
      </p>
      <p>
          By default, all messages sent with a test key will result in a delivered status.
      </p>
      <p>
          If you want to test failure statuses with a test key, use the following phone numbers and email addresses:

          <li>"07700900003" => temporary failure</li>
          <li>"07700900002" => permanent failure</li>
          <li>"temp-fail@simulator.notify" => temporary failure</li>
          <li>"perm-fail@simulator.notify" => permanent failure</li>
      </p>
  </div>
</div>
