    <h2 class="heading-medium" id="invoices">
      Invoices
    </h2>

    <p>
      We’ll send your organisation an invoice each quarter if:
    </p>

    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>you exceed the free text message allowance</li>
      <li>you send letters</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If your organisation has more than one service that owes money the invoice will be broken down by service.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the invoice is less than £250 (before <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>) we’ll roll it into the next quarter’s invoice to save time and effort.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can pay by BACS, debit card, or credit card.
    </p>

    <h2 class="heading-medium" id="purchase-orders">
      Purchase orders
    </h2>

    <p>
      If your organisation’s annual usage will cost over £500 (before <abbr title="Value Added Tax">VAT</abbr>) you need to provide us with a purchase order so we can invoice you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your organisation should raise a single purchase order to cover the estimated annual usage costs for all your Notify services. This purchase order should be updated if the estimated annual usage costs increase.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may need to set up Cabinet Office as a supplier before you can raise a purchase order. If you need any details to do that, please <a href="{{ support_link }}">get in touch with us</a>.
