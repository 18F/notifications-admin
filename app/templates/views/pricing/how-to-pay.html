      <p>
        We’ll send your organisation an invoice each quarter if:
      </p>

      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>you exceed the free text message allowance</li>
        <li>you send letters</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If your organisation has more than one service that owes money the invoice will be broken down by service.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the invoice is less than £250 +VAT, we’ll roll it into the next quarter’s invoice to save time and effort.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can pay by BACS, debit card, or credit card.
      </p>

      <h2 class="heading-medium" id="purchase-orders">
        Purchase orders
      </h2>

      <p>
        If your organisation’s annual usage will cost over £500 +VAT you need to provide us with a purchase order so we can invoice you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your organisation should raise a single purchase order to cover the estimated annual usage costs for all your Notify services. This purchase order should be updated if the estimated annual usage costs increase.
      </p>

      <p>
        You may need to set up Cabinet Office as a supplier before you can raise a purchase order. If you need any details to do that, please <a href="{{ support_link }}">get in touch with us</a>.
