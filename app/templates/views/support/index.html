    <h2 class="heading-medium">Office hours</h2>
    <p>Our office hours are 9:30am to 5:30pm, Monday to Friday.</p>
    <p>When you report a problem in office hours, we’ll aim to read it within 30 minutes and reply within one working day.</p>

    <h2 class="heading-medium">Out-of-hours</h2>
    <p>Outside office hours, response times depend on whether you’re reporting an emergency.</p>
    <p>If it’s an emergency, we’ll reply within 30 minutes and update you every hour until the problem’s fixed.</p>
    <p>If your problem is not an emergency, we’ll reply within one working day.</p>
    <p>A problem is only classed as an emergency if:</p>
    <ul class="list list-bullet">
      <li>nobody on your team can sign in</li>
      <li>a ‘technical difficulties’ error appears when you try to upload a file</li>
      <li>a 500 response code appears when you try to send messages using the API</li>
    </ul>
