        <p>
          We offer 24 hour online support if you have a GOV.UK Notify
          account and we’ve made your service live. We have different
          response times depending on whether the problem you want to
          report is an emergency.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s only an emergency if:
        </p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>
            no one in your team can log in
          </li>
          <li>
            a ‘technical difficulties’ error appears when you try to
            upload a file
          </li>
          <li>
            a 500 response code appears when you try to send messages
            using the API
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We’ll reply within 30 minutes and give you hourly updates
          until the problem’s fixed.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ll reply by the next working day for any other problems.
